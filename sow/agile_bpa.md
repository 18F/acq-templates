### 1.0. BACKGROUND

The U.S. General Services Administration (the Servicing Agency), through its Office of Citizen Services, Innovative Technologies and 18F, builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between Government and the people and businesses it serves. 18F helps agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services. Our mission is to transform the way the government builds and buys IT, with an emphasis on public-facing digital services. One of the services 18F offers to agencies is Acquisition Services where 18F provides hands-on acquisition consulting services to Federal program managers and other leaders who need assistance in procuring software that use modern development techniques (e.g., agile, lean, open source).

For purposes of this Statement of Work (SOW), the Requesting Agency is the {{requestingAgency.name}}. The Requesting Agency requires the services of GSA through 18F to assist in the preparation of essential documents, such as the solicitation, for the procurement of information technology to enable several enterprise endeavors related to separate acquisition activities. {{requestingAgency.objective}}.

Through this agreement, GSA will complete a discovery sprint, scoping workshop, drafting process, and a technical evaluation with the Requesting Agency personnel for award. The discovery sprint will ideally last no more than two weeks, but may go longer if necessary, in order to properly delineate the scope of the challenges to be addressed. It is anticipated that the discovery sprint will result in a set of recommendations for next steps which will focus on successful use of 18F’s Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (aBPA).

Following the discovery period, 18F will conduct solicitation (RFx) workshops with subsequent drafting of necessary documents for use of the aBPA. The RFx workshop and drafting process for the aBPA shall include, at a minimum, the following: reviewing any relevant proposed procurement artifacts, generating new documents to satisfy the requirements, and ensure proper alignment so that any procurement process takes full advantage of leading acquisition practices, such as modular procurement, modern digital practices, such as user-centered design, agile development, application programming interfaces, and open source technologies. Following the completion of the discovery and scoping portions of this agreement, 18F will use the workshop outputs created to issue an order on the aBPA.

For aBPA task orders, 18F is responsible for managing the vendor, development of the work product, and acceptance of a minimally viable product (MVP) based on the Requesting Agency’s stated objective provided above. This effort is focused on ensuring that the performance under the task order complies with 18F’s guiding principles as well as agile, digital standards generally. This IAA does not create a contractual relationship of any kind between the Requesting Agency and the aBPA vendor performing on any task order. Instead the Requesting Agency is a third party beneficiary of the yet created MVP.

### 2.0 SCOPE OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES

18F will provide the Requesting Agency with the following:

1.  Undertake an initial discovery sprint to scope out challenges to be addressed with written recommendations and findings;

2.  Facilitate solicitation (RFx) workshop(s) with key Requesting Agency stakeholders to define key requirements and acquisition strategy;

3.  Draft language for inclusion in new procurement documents (e.g. PWS/SOO for a RFx); draft other required artifacts such as cost estimate(s) or justifications for an aBPA task order;

4.  Manage competitive bidding process amongst aBPA awardees for the task order including the technical evaluation for award of the task order;

5.  Perform administrative functions related to post-award management of the aBPA task order to completion (e.g. managing sprints and conducting quality assurance and surveillance with any necessary corrective actions);

Key principles that guide 18F’s work with its clients:

1.  Make appropriate use of human/user-centered design and software development methodologies (e.g., agile).

2.  Take appropriate steps to ensure technical practices are adhered in order to increase modularity and to avoid vendor lock-in.

3.  Make appropriate use of open-source software, and selects modern technology stacks to ensure long-term sustainability for the project.

4.  Incorporate proven, commodity IT solutions (e.g., Commercial Off-The-Shelf solutions).

5.  Include explicit, results-oriented success criteria.

6.  Use the appropriate technical terminology to avoid ambiguity.

7.  Specify the necessary technical knowledge, skills, and abilities that the vendor must possess in order to execute the contract successfully.

8.  Take advantage of the “plays” set forth in the *[U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/)*.

The acquisition-oriented consulting services under this agreement will not include a legal review of any Requesting Agency procurement. Additionally, 18F shall not be acting with procurement authority on behalf of the Requesting Agency at any point in this engagement. The Requesting Agency is responsible for obtaining a legal review from the Requesting Agency personnel authorized to provide legal services to the requesting agency as well as acting as its own procurement authority.
