# templates

A collection of templatized standard 18F documents, written in Markdown with Handlebars templating.

## Adding a template
If you are creating a template, please check if there is an existing template type, via the directories. If there is an existing directory to accommodate your template type, please add your template in the respective folder. Please create an issue if your template fields are not covered by the existing sample data `json` in that directory.

If you are creating your own template type, please create a new directory in the top level folder. The directory should include your template in a `.md` file, and a `.json` of sample data for that template.

All templates must be in a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) form using [handlesbars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
