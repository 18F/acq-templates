During this process, Offeror(s) shall direct all written or verbal communications to the contracting specialist. Communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and, for this reason, aren’t allowed. If Offerors communicate with anyone on the Government’s team other than the contracting specialist, they’ll be removed from award consideration.
 
Offerors are required to submit a signed Potential Organizational Conflict of Interest Statement (COI). If the Offeror has any potential organizational conflicts of interest, they must provide a statement describing the potential or actual COI with their quote. The information in this statement must be accurate and complete so that a CO can assess the nature of the potential conflict of interest.
 
Finally, Offerors must provide their COI responses in the appropriate field of the provided Google Form in order to be considered for award.

### 5.2 Written quote submission
#### 5.2.1 Technical quote
To make the process easier for potential Offerors, we have provided a Google Form for the written technical quote portion of submissions.

**Written technical quotes will only be accepted via the provided Google Form.**
 
**The Google Form is available [here]({{urlRFQForm).**

#### 5.2.2 Written price quote
Offerors must submit a separate price quotation using the provided worksheet template in the eBuy system. **The price quotation must be received no later than the due date indicated above.**

### 5.3 Verbal presentations agenda
| **No.** | **AGENDA ITEM** | **MAXIMUM TIME** |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1 | Introductions | Approximately 5 minutes |
| 2 | Open Technical Session | 40 minutes |
| 3 | Closing Remarks and Frequently Asked Questions | 5 minutes |

#### Rules
No part of these verbal presentations - for example, discussions and negotiations - constitutes a procedure in FAR Part 15. For this reason, the Government is not obligated to (and will not) determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, and request quote revisions.

The verbal presentation consists of an unstructured question and answer session on technical factors. The entire verbal presentation will take place remotely via video chat and/or teleconference.

Offerors will not be able to use or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials, including handouts.

#### Content
During the technical session, the Offeror will respond to Government’s questions related to the technical factors identified in this solicitation.
 
Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member’s names and roles on both the Government and vendor teams. Time for introductions will not be allocated to business development purposes.


Although the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are
Not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer questions about the technical factors of their respective technical quotes. The goal of these presentations is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed Key Personnel and further elaborate on their proposed technical approach to accomplish the objectives of this task.

This part of the verbal presentations will not exceed 40 minutes. The Contracting Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all presentations. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the presentation.
 
The session will conclude with closing remarks and responses to frequently asked questions for Offerors.

#### Presentation location
Verbal Presentations will take place via video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using a tool such as Zoom or Appear.in).

#### Presentation date and time
The Government will schedule the date and time of the verbal presentations with each Offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each Offeror’s quote submission. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any Offeror’s verbal presentations date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

#### Presentation participants
**Proposed key personnel must participate in the verbal presentation. Otherwise, the Offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded from further consideration.**
 
Offerors may include as many participants as are necessary. Offerors should note that the Government will be asking technical questions during the verbal presentation, so non-technical personnel may not need to attend.
 
All proposed key personnel currently employed by the Offeror or its teaming partners must attend the session - the Government is most interested in hearing from staff who will have a direct role in completing the task.
 
After the presentations, vendors must email the meeting organizers the names of everyone who attended.

## 6.0 Evaluation
### 6.1 Technical Evaluation Factors
**Composition of the team**
Key personnel proposed have demonstrated experience in:
- Building software using the technical languages outlined in section 2.2
- Developing software in the open
- Using a strong user-centered product development technical approach
- Their ability to work in using Scrum or another Agile framework
- The ability to empathize and work with different personalities

**Vendor Experience/Skill**
Vendor’s proposal includes:
- At least 2 but no more than 3 projects involving the languages outlined in section 2.2 as well as the key personnel being put forward. If one repo has one language and another repo has another language, that’s fine as well. Meaning, each repo does not need to include everything outlined in 2.2, but projects submitted should show mastery in all those things.

### 6.2 Price evaluation
A reasonable price that is consistent with industry standards and the vendor’s proposed approach, but not necessarily the lowest. We intend to be able to pick the vendor that has the best technical factors rather than the best price. If we have to choose between the two factors, technical factors will significantly outweigh price.

### 6.3 Evaluation process
Review the responses to the questions in the Technical Quote to ensure they demonstrate an understanding of the requirements outlined in the PWS, particularly section 2.2 (the ability to work with the existing tech stack here will be important), and the strength of their proposed user-research and Agile and development practices.
 
Review vendor website, company and personnel github profiles, example projects, and resumes for proposed personnel for strength of experience in relevant projects.
 
We will review of Google Form responses for the strength and feasibility of the proposed technical approach, the level of knowledge in the specified technical stack in section 2.2 that is possessed by the personnel put forward by the vendor and within the repositories provided as examples, and the ability of the team to get along with one another and the Government’s team.
 
There is the potential that not everyone is going to be invited to:
 
The verbal presentation will be used to validate the technical approach put forward in the written presentation and verify how the proposed team will accomplish it. The verbal presentation will also evaluate how effectively the proposed team communicates and whether there are any intangibles (such as corporate culture and individual personality factors) about the team that may not come out in a written document.

## 7.0 Basis for award
We want to select a vendor that put forward the most sensible (“best”) technical approach, key personnel that can fulfill the objectives, a reasonable price (not necessarily the lowest), the ability to not only work the way we want (open source, user-centered design, Scrum, etc.), and not only the ability to work well together but also work well with the particular personalities that exist on the Government’s team (based on interactions during the verbal presentation).
