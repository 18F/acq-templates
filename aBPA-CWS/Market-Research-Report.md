Research
"Per Acquisition Alert 2014-07, GSA contracting officers must consider existing GSA contract vehicles in their acquisition planning after the consideration of mandatory sources which are not suitable for this requirement. Utilizing GSA e-Library, the market research team reviewed the scope of services available on GSA Schedule IT Schedule 70 (IT 70). IT 70 is “the largest, most widely used acquisition vehicle in the federal government. Schedule 70 is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award schedule, providing direct access to products, services and solutions from more than 5,000 certified industry partners.”

In addition to determining that the requirements of this action may be satisfied from the sources available on IT 70, our research further determined that these services can be provided under the already established agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (aBPA). In accordance with FAR 8.405-3(a)(3)(i), the aBPA was competitively established against IT 70 with 17 awardees, comprised of 9 small businesses and 8 other than small businesses.

The aBPA was established to acquire full-stack development teams, meaning all necessary technology layers required for functioning applications from front to back, for TTS-managed projects. Based on the knowledge, skills, and expertise of the 17 awardee’s personnel, based on labor category descriptions, this work is well within the scope of the aBPA contractor’s ability to build the necessary application.

Conclusion
Using the aBPA for this requirement is the most suitable strategy for cost, time, and performance as the resulting call order will deliver the requirement with greater speed, in an agile way to successfully develop the necessary application. Given that any of the aBPA contractors are able to perform this work, TTS will use competitive call order procedures per FAR Part 8.4 to determine the best value offer to the Government for this effort.
