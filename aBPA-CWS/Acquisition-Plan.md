## 7.105(a) Acquisition background and objectives
### 7.105(a)(1) Statement of need
#### Background and Objectives	
{{paragraphSplit}}{{askBackground}}	

#### Contractual history	
{{iaaHistory}}
{{iaaPreviousContractNumbers}}
{{iaaOtherCompaniesInvolved}}

#### Acquisition alternatives	
There are no existing Government efforts to perform same or similar work with in-house employees. It is not feasible for the Requiring Agency to perform this effort in-house with Government employees, nor is it feasible to perform this effort under an agreement with another Government agency using the Required Agency’s Government employees.

**Full and Open Competition:** Market research revealed that the requirement is within scope of an existing contract vehicle that can meet the Government’s requirements. Therefore, a full and open competition is not considered to be an optimal solution.

**Non-GSA GWAC (including NASA SEWP III, ECSIII, and NIH CIO-SP2):** While these GWACS allow for a variety of order types, there were no scope area provisions that distinguish them from General Services Administration (“GSA”) contract vehicles. The additional time and expense required initiating a new acquisition with a non-GSA vehicle and contracting office during both the acquisition cycle and administration of the task order cannot be justified. Therefore, a NON-GSA GWAC is not considered to be an optimal solution.

**GSA GWACs (including Alliant, Alliant SB, VETS):** GSA GWAC’s provide for various services including Information Technology, Financial Services and other Professional Service solutions. Although the predominant nature of the current requirement is Information Technology services, it is not the most optimal contract vehicle for meeting the Government’s requirements; therefore, a GSA GWAC is not considered because there is an existing internal BPA that aligns with the services.

**FSS Schedule:** Agile Delivery Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (“aBPA”), a contracting vehicle from 18F Consulting, creates an opportunity for members of the vendor community who specialize in agile software development to provide those services to GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (“TTS”).

Due to the nature of this requirement, this acquisition will be issued in accordance under the aBPA Pool 3 Full Stack, under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (“MAS”), also known as Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) contract, Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, under Special Item Number (“SIN”) 132-51, Information Technology Professional Services.

### 7.105(a)(2) Applicable conditions	
The Contractor shall abide by the following	

(i) Requirements for compatibility with existing or future systems or programs:	

{{askTechConstraints}}

(ii) Any known cost, schedule, and capability or performance constraints:

The Interagency Agreement (“IAA”) between the Requiring Agency and GSA has a maximum of ${{iaaTotal}} in available budget for contract costs. In addition, it is {{iaaColor}}.

### 7.105(a)(3) Costs
N/A. There are no life cycle costs associated with this Information Technology (“IT”) acquisition.

### 7.105(a)(4) Capability or performance conditions
The Government will use the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (“QASP”) it has developed to monitor the vendor’s performance. The QASP will provide oversight help to ensure that service levels reach and maintain the required levels for performance of this task. Furthermore, the QASP provides the Government with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required Past Performance Information Assessments. The QASP is a living document and may be updated by the Government as necessary. Any updates to the QASP will be provided to the vendor. If needed, the QASP will be updated within ten business days of the vendor kickoff meeting by either the TTS Product Lead or the COR/ACOR.

### 7.105(a)(5) Delivery or performance-period requirements
The Period of Performance (“POP”) is a based period of po-email. The POP is expected to begin ten calendar days after award. The anticipated award date is tech-constraints.

### 7.105(a)(6) Trade offs
{{awardTradeOffs}}

### 7.105(a)(7) Risks
There are no risks that are specific to this project.

## 7.105(b) Plan of action
### 7.105(b)(5) Acquisition considerations
#### Equipment lease or purchase
This requirement does not involve lease or purchase items.

#### Section 508
The contractor shall support the Government in its conformance with Section 508 throughout the development and implementation of the work to be performed.

The following standard is applicable for compliance: 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications.

The contractor should review the following websites for additional 508 information:

- https://www.section508.gov/
- https://www.access-board.gov/508
- https://www.w3.org/WAI/

#### Performance based elements
Performance based elements will be used to the maximum extent practicable because there are metrics and standards, such as open source code, human-centered design, an extensible infrastructure, robust documentation, and other deliverables that need to be achieved in accordance with certain performance objectives. Requirements have been defined by the Performance Work Statement (“PWS”) with expected outcomes; the contractor will be required to submit a Quality Assurance Plan (“QAP”); and the contractor’s performance will be monitored based on the Government’s Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (“QASP”).

#### Monitoring office (or individual)
The following individuals will monitor contractor performance:

- Client Technical Point of Contact: {{pocCOR}}
- GSA FAS Program Manager: Lindsey Pangretic
- GSA FAS Contracting Specialist: {{pocCS}}
- GSA FAS Contracting Officer: {{pocCO}}

AAS will perform all Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) responsibilities for the resulting contract. The COR responsibilities will be described in a COR Letter or Appointment. The COR and Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) will be responsible for quality assurance surveillance. The AAS Contracting Officer (CO) has the authority for issuing modifications and changes.

#### Rationale for not using performance based contracting methods
Not applicable, as performance based elements will be used to the maximum extent practicable.

### 7.105(b)(6) Budgeting and funding
Services to be provided under this task order are {{iaaServices}}. Funds have been designated for the base period under Interagency Agreement Number {{iaaNumber}} in the amount of ${{iaaTotal}}.

### 7.105(b)(7) Product or service descriptions
We are purchasing development services in order to achieve the following:

### 7.105(b)(15) Government furnished property
The Government will not furnish any property in accordance with performance under the contract.

### 7.105(b)(16) Government furnished information
The Government will furnish any necessary data at time of award.

### 7.105(b)(18) Security considerations
Performance of this task order will require compliance with CIO 2102.1 Information Technology (IT) Integration Policy (https://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/673470). As a result, privacy is a non-issue with respect to this procurement, and all security regulations will be followed.

This acquisition will be administered by the following individuals:

- Client Technical Point of Contact: {{pocCOR}}
- GSA FAS Program Manager: Lindsey Pangretic
