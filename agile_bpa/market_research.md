MARKET RESEARCH REPORT for {{ buy.name }}
======================

The purpose of this market research report is to satisfy the requirements as outlined within Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and to determine the most suitable approach to acquiring the services required in the {{ buy.name }}.

The market research team focused on reviewing the GSA e-Library of Schedule 70 under FAR Part 8.  GSA Schedule 70 is marketed as follows: “IT Schedule 70 is the largest, most widely used acquisition vehicle in the federal government. Schedule 70 is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award schedule, providing direct access to products, services and solutions from more than 5,000 certified industry partners.”

In accordance with FAR 8.405-3(a)(1), Ordering activities may establish BPAs under any schedule contract to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services. Ordering activities shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that can provide the supply or service that represents the best value.

Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 8.405-3(a)(3)(i), The ordering activity contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to establishing multiple-award BPAs, rather than establishing a single-award BPA.

18F’s Agile BPA Pool 3 in essence are multi-award BPAs set up with 17 vendors (8 other than small businesses and 9 small businesses). It was established to acquire development, design, and full-stack teams to help work on 18F-managed projects. This is part of 18F's efforts to increase our capacity to help agency partners do great work, through using agile processes to transform the way the federal government buys and builds digital services. Please visit https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/buyers/ for more information and the list of 17 vendors.

18F will use competitive call order procedures against 18F’s Agile BPA Pool 3 to establish a call order against it. The resulting call order will deliver the requirement with greater speed, and with a contractor that has already been identified as capable of working in an agile way.
